<div>
    <p>I wanted to present a project of a page which was inrteged with <b><a href="https://shrtco.de/">shrtcode API</a></b> shrtcode API to create a shortened URL address and be able to display it on the page.</p>
    <p>The main goal is for the user to be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
        <li>Shorten any valid URL</li>
        <li>See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser</li>
        <li>Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click</li>
        <li>Receive an error message when the form is submitted if The input field is empty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To achieve my goal, I created the whole application using React.js library.</p>
    <p>The idea and design was taken from the website: <b><a href="www.frontendmentor.io">www.frontendmentor.io</a></b></p>
